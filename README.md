Blockchain Tokenomics Incentive system for Recycling Water Bottles

Proposed by:
Kareem Kassab &
Omar Osman

Problem Discussion:


Environmental Aspect: Recycling Projects serve different UN SDGs including goals 3, 11,12, 13,14, and 15 of good health and well being (plastic wastes can be found in our food and water), sustainable cities, responsible consumption and production (of plastics and consumables in general), climate action (recyclable plastics are destroying environments by increasing ocean temperature), life below water, and life on land (because plastics are destroying habitats)

UN, Governments, and NGOs want to incentivise recycling to solve previously described issues for the good of their people.

    Technical Aspects: for incentive and points systems, there may be issues related to: 
People wanting to spend tokens on different things (most probably these are used as a customer retention either way). Tokenomics can allow these to be used/swapped to other ecosystems where people can be truly incentivised to recycle

Fairness and security. If we want action to happen, we want incentives to have the power to move people, aka become valuable, and if digital things become valuable, blockchains would be best to sustain a token economy that is fair in distribution and secure for all public users.
 




Business Plan & Tokenomics:
    
Stakeholders: 
UN
Governments and NGOs
Plastic bottle manufacturers
Customers

Project Sustainability:
 For the project to prosper we need all stakeholders to gain some kind of value. 
The UN and governments will participate with funding in exchange for keeping their world/countries/areas clean and saving money on curing environmental disasters.
Water bottle manufacturers and plastic factories, currently buy the empty bottles for their recycling either way and can participate with part of the funding in exchange for getting plastic back already classified by customers
Customers,  can get back some money for giving other stakeholders value by getting points that they can actually use for things they like.

Main Funding: governments, NGOs, companies.

Marketing Plan:
Mainly around universities, clubs, sport hubs, and places with high water bottle consumption that can act as collection hubs.

Code Development Plan:
Random code generator for bottles
Scanning a code to ensure unique bottle insertion
Validating the code belongs to the group of valid bottle codes
Requesting user address
Calling a smart contract with the consumer wallet address+ water bottle code as inputs.






Future Insights (Business):
Business can later be extended to:
Recycling other products


Future Insights (code):
Features can later be extended to:
Scan other forms of code (bar code, QR code, etc..)
